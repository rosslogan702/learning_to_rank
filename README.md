# Learning to Rank

This repo contains 3 approaches that can be applied to data science problems known as learning to rank.

The 3 approaches that were considered in this repository were pointwise, pairwise and listwise.   

Each approach has a sample implementation that was trained and tested against a benchmark dataset using a set of evaluation metrics.

## Approaches

* Pointwise
* Pairwise
* Listwise

## Benchmark Dataset

The dataset used is the Microsoft Learning to Rank 10K (MSLR-10K).
